            <p class="content-text">
                After the celestial tribulation in "Ne Zha: The Demon Child Reborn", Ne Zha and Ao Bing, though their physical bodies were destroyed, were given new lives by Taiyi Zhenren who recreated their bodies with the Seven-Colored Lotus. However, challenges to their fate followed one after another. Shen Gong Bao led the dragon clan in a fierce attack, and Ao Bing's soul was forced to possess Ne Zha's body. What was more troublesome was that they learned that if Ao Bing was to survive completely, they had to pass the "Immortal Examination" at Yuxu Palace within seven days and obtain the nectar of immortality. Otherwise, Ao Bing's soul would disperse, and the Dragon King Ao Guang would angrily destroy Chen Tang Pass.
            </p>
            
            <p class="content-text">
                Ne Zha and Ao Bing embarked on a perilous journey to Yuxu Palace. Along the way, they gradually uncovered the shocking conspiracy hidden within Yuxu Palace. It turned out that Yuxu Palace, under the guise of the "Demon-Slaying Team" to protect justice in the world, was actually using the captured demons to refine immortal elixirs to consolidate its rule over the immortal realm. The so-called "demon-slaying" was nothing but a bloody massacre. Innocent groundhog demons, who were merely starving people seeking survival, were brutally killed by the Demon-Slaying Team; the little demons led by Shen Gong Bao's father also could not escape the fate of being slaughtered. Shen Gong Bao, having participated in such despicable acts, was tormented by his conscience and ultimately chose to defect, completely removing the false mask of the immortal Wuliang.
            </p>
            
            <p class="content-text">
                Facing this dark truth, Ne Zha and Ao Bing did not retreat. They decided to join forces with the dragon clan and many oppressed demons to resist the cruel rule of the immortal realm. The battle between immortals and demons was about to break out. On the battlefield, Ne Zha, who initially rebelled against his personal fate as a demon child, grew into a hero who dared to confront social injustice, breaking the immortal realm's rigid definition of "immortals" and "demons", and revealing the hypocrisy behind the power structure to everyone. Ao Bing also broke free from the shackles of his family's fate and bravely stood by Ne Zha's side to fight for justice. The Dragon King Ao Guang, though powerful, had been blinded by hatred before but eventually recognized the reality and chose to cooperate with Ne Zha, leading the dragon clan to resist the oppression of the immortal realm.

            <p class="content-text">
                In the end, with the joint efforts of everyone, immortal Wuliang was defeated, and his conspiracy was exposed to the world. In the post-credits scene, Shen Gong Bao and his father were imprisoned, hinting at the ongoing power struggle within the immortal realm, far from over, and setting the stage for future stories with a mysterious twist.
